Consumer Complaint Text Classification
This project classifies consumer complaints into four categories:

Credit Reporting

Debt Collection

Consumer Loan

Mortgage

The classification is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models.

Project Steps
Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

Text Preprocessing

Selection of Multi-Class Classification Models

Comparison of Model Performance

Model Evaluation

Prediction on New Complaints

1Ô∏è‚É£ How to Run the Project
üîπ Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Information
The dataset is downloaded from Consumer Complaint Database

It contains customer complaints and their respective product categories.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Steps to Execute the Project
Step 1: Load the Dataset
Run Consumer_Complaint_Classification.py

The dataset is loaded using:

python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.read_csv("Consumer_Complaints.csv")
df = df[['Product', 'Consumer complaint narrative']].dropna()
Feature Engineering: Mapping product names to labels.

Step 2: Text Preprocessing
Convert text to lowercase.

Remove special characters and stopwords.

Tokenization using NLTK.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    text = word_tokenize(text)
    return " ".join(text)
Step 3: Train Multi-Class Classification Models
Convert text to TF-IDF Vector Representation.

Split data into Train/Test sets.

Train different models:

Na√Øve Bayes

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
Step 4: Model Comparison & Evaluation
Performance Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

python
Copy
Edit
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Model Comparison Plot:

python
Copy
Edit
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.barplot(x=list(results.keys()), y=list(results.values()))
Step 5: Prediction
The trained model can classify new complaints.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
sample_text = "I have issues with my mortgage payment."
print("Predicted Category:", predict_category(sample_text))
