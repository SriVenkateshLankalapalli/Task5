# Task5
This project focuses on text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The goal is to categorize consumer complaints into four predefined categories based on textual data from the Consumer Complaint Database (available at Data.gov).

📝 Categories of Complaints
0️⃣ Credit Reporting, Repair, or Other
1️⃣ Debt Collection
2️⃣ Consumer Loan
3️⃣ Mortgage

📌 Key Steps in the Project
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering – Analyze the dataset, clean missing values, and extract useful features.
✔ Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
✔ Multi-Class Classification Model Selection – Train different models such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM.
✔ Model Comparison & Performance Analysis – Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
✔ Prediction – Classify new consumer complaints using the best-performing model.
